# Privacy Policy

## What Information Do We Collect?

We neither gather nor retain any form of personal data.

Your chosen settings, such as the option to display tone marks, are stored either locally or with the corporation linked to the account you are logged into. For more information, please see the following section.

## Data Storage

This extension utilises the `storage.sync` method to maintain the user's chosen settings, such as the option to display tone marks, thereby facilitating the browser to synchronise these settings. As a result, these settings become available on all instances of the browser the user is logged into (for example, when using a Mozilla account on desktop versions of Firefox or a Google account on Chrome) across different devices.

For further information, you may refer to these documents: [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync), [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage), [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/api-support).

## Modifications to the Privacy Policy

It is unlikely that we will make alterations to our Privacy Policy. However, in the event of any changes, they will be posted on this page.

## Contact

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you are welcome to contact me or initiate an issue in this repository for inquiry.
