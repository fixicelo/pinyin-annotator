## Making production build

Apart from obtaining the extension from your browser's dedicated extension store, you can clone this repository and build it yourself.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build

# or

npm install
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, and ready to be loaded into your browser. For further reference, you may consult the [Plasmo documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework).

## Sponsor

This is a totally free and ad-free browser extension. But if you are feeling generous, you could always [buy me a tea](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fixicelo). This would help offset the 99 bucks Apple developer fee I have to pay each year to keep the Safari extension going.
